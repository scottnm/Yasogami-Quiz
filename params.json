","body":"### Yasogami High Final Exam Prep\r\nFor [r/JSTogether's](http://reddit.com/r/jstogether) first project, we were supposed to create a simple quiz application that tallies a users answers and provides a score at the end to the user. I have built a simple application in style of those \"What character are you?\" quizzees that used to plague everyone's myspace and facebook pages. The only difference is that it is framed as the user preparing for his/her final exam at Yasogami High School with all of the questions being actual quiz questions from Persona 4. At the end of the quiz your performance is graded and you are compared to one of the 8 main crime solvers.\r\n\r\n[Demo Here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QaAhf2bNDS8)\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
